# Module 2: Introduction to Flutter

## 1. Introduction to Flutter Framework

### 1.1 Overview of Flutter and Its Architecture
Flutter is an open-source UI toolkit developed by Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Its architecture is built around the following key concepts:

- **Widgets**: Everything in Flutter is a widget. Widgets are the building blocks of the Flutter app's user interface (UI).
- **Dart Language**: Flutter uses the Dart programming language, which allows for fast development and high performance.
- **Rendering Engine**: Flutter has its own rendering engine, which enables it to draw UI components directly onto the screen.

#### Key Components of Flutter Architecture:
1. **Framework**: Provides a rich set of pre-built widgets, state management, and tools for layout.
2. **Engine**: The low-level rendering engine responsible for rendering the UI, handling text layout, and supporting platform-specific APIs.
3. **Embedder**: Provides the interface to the host operating system, allowing Flutter apps to run on different platforms.

**Questions:**
1. What is the primary purpose of Flutter?
2. How does Flutter manage the UI using widgets?
3. What programming language does Flutter use, and why is it advantageous?

### 1.2 Understanding Flutter Widgets
Widgets are the core of Flutter's UI. There are two main types of widgets:
- **Stateless Widgets**: These widgets do not maintain any state. They are immutable, meaning once created, their properties cannot change.
- **Stateful Widgets**: These widgets maintain a state that can change during the lifetime of the widget.

#### Example of a Stateless Widget:
```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class MyStatelessWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Text('Hello, Flutter!'),
    );
  }
}
```

#### Example of a Stateful Widget:
```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class MyStatefulWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyStatefulWidgetState createState() => _MyStatefulWidgetState();
}

class _MyStatefulWidgetState extends State<MyStatefulWidget> {
  int _counter = 0;

  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter++;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Text('Counter: $_counter'),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _incrementCounter,
          child: Text('Increment'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

**Questions:**
1. What is the difference between stateless and stateful widgets?
2. When would you use a stateful widget instead of a stateless widget?
3. Can you explain the build method in the context of widgets?

### 1.3 Setting Up the Flutter Development Environment
To start developing Flutter apps, follow these steps:

1. **Install Flutter SDK**: Download the Flutter SDK from [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
2. **Set Up an IDE**: You can use Visual Studio Code or Android Studio, both of which support Flutter development with plugins.
3. **Create a New Flutter Project**:
   ```
   flutter create my_first_app
   cd my_first_app
   flutter run
   ```

**Questions:**
1. What steps are necessary to set up the Flutter development environment?
2. Which IDEs are recommended for Flutter development?
3. What command is used to create a new Flutter project?

### 1.4 Creating Your First Flutter App
Your first Flutter app will display a simple "Hello, World!" message. Hereâ€™s how to create it:

1. Open the `lib/main.dart` file in your project.
2. Replace its contents with the following code:
   ```
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

   void main() {
     runApp(MyApp());
   }

   class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return MaterialApp(
         home: Scaffold(
           appBar: AppBar(title: Text('My First App')),
           body: Center(child: Text('Hello, World!')),
         ),
       );
     }
   }
   ```
3. Save and run the app using:
   ```
   flutter run
   ```

**Questions:**
1. What does the `runApp` function do in a Flutter application?
2. What is the purpose of the `MaterialApp` widget?
3. How can you customize the app's title in the AppBar?

---

## 2. Stateless and Stateful Widgets

### 2.1 Building Simple UIs with Stateless Widgets
Stateless widgets are ideal for UIs that don't need to change over time. You can create complex UIs by composing multiple stateless widgets.

#### Example:
```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class SimpleUI extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Simple UI')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          Text('This is a simple UI.'),
          Icon(Icons.star, size: 50),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**Questions:**
1. How do you create a simple UI using stateless widgets?
2. What types of widgets can be included within a Column widget?
3. What role does the `Scaffold` widget play in the UI structure?

### 2.2 Stateful Widgets for Dynamic UIs
Stateful widgets are used when the UI depends on some mutable state. Whenever the state changes, the UI will update.

#### Example:
```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class CounterApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CounterAppState createState() => _CounterAppState();
}

class _CounterAppState extends State<CounterApp> {
  int _count = 0;

  void _incrementCount() {
    setState(() {
      _count++;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Counter App')),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Count: $_count'),
            ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: _incrementCount,
              child: Text('Increment'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**Questions:**
1. How does the `setState` method work in a Stateful widget?
2. Why is it important to call `setState` when updating the UI?
3. What happens to the state of a Stateful widget when it is removed from the widget tree?

### 2.3 Widget Lifecycle
Stateful widgets have a lifecycle that includes several important methods:
- **initState**: Called when the widget is first created.
- **didChangeDependencies**: Called when the widget's dependencies change.
- **build**: Called to describe the widget in terms of other, lower-level widgets.
- **dispose**: Called when the widget is removed from the tree.

Example of overriding lifecycle methods:
```
class MyWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyWidgetState createState() => _MyWidgetState();
}

class _MyWidgetState extends State<MyWidget> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Initialization logic here
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Clean up resources here
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

**Questions:**
1. What are the main methods in the lifecycle of a Stateful widget?
2. When is the `dispose` method called, and why is it important?
3. What is the purpose of the `initState` method in a Stateful widget?

## 3. Flutter Layouts and Styling

### 3.1 Understanding Layout Widgets (Row, Column, Stack)
Flutter uses a rich set of layout widgets to organize UI elements.

- **Row**: Arranges children in a horizontal line.
- **Column**: Arranges children in a vertical line.
- **Stack**: Allows children to be placed on top of each other.

#### Example:
```
class LayoutExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        Row(
          children: [Icon(Icons.star), Text('Star')],
        ),
        Stack(
          children: [
            Container(color: Colors.red, width: 100, height: 100),
            Container(color: Colors.blue, width: 50, height: 50),
          ],
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

**Questions:**
1. How does the `Row` widget arrange its children?
2. What is the primary difference between a `Column` and a `Stack`?
3. Can you give an example of when to use a `Stack` layout?

### 3.2 Container, Padding, and Spacing Widgets
- **Container**: A versatile widget for styling, padding, and decoration.
- **Padding**: Adds space around a widget.
- **SizedBox**: Creates a box with a specific size.

#### Example:
```
class ContainerExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
        color: Colors.green,
        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8.0),
      ),
      child: Text('Hello, Container!'),
    );
  }
}
```

**Questions:**
1. What is the purpose of the `Container` widget in Flutter?
2. How can you use the `Padding` widget effectively in your layouts?
3. What is a `SizedBox`, and when would you use it?

### 3.3 Customizing Styles (Colors, Fonts, Themes)
Customizing the look and feel of your app involves using colors, fonts, and themes.

#### Example of using themes:
```
class ThemedApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
        textTheme: TextTheme(
          bodyText2: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, color: Colors.black),
        ),
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Themed App')),
        body: Center(child: Text('Hello, Themed World!')),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**Questions:**
1. How can you implement custom themes in your Flutter app?
2. What is the purpose of the `ThemeData` class?
3. How can you use custom fonts in Flutter?

### 3.4 Responsive Design in Flutter
Responsive design ensures your app looks good on various screen sizes. Use `MediaQuery` to get the size of the screen.

#### Example:
```
class ResponsiveExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final screenWidth = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width;

    return Container(
      width: screenWidth < 600 ? 100 : 200,
      height: 100,
      color: Colors.amber,
    );
  }
}
```

**Questions:**
1. Why is responsive design important in Flutter applications?
2. How can you determine the screen size in Flutter?
3. What strategies can you use to create a responsive layout?

## 4. Handling User Input

### 4.1 TextFields, Buttons, and Forms
Flutter provides various widgets to handle user input, such as `TextField`, `ElevatedButton`, and `Form`.

#### Example of a TextField:
```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class InputExample extends StatelessWidget {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Input Example')),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          TextField(controller: _controller),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              print('Input: ${_controller.text}');
            },
            child: Text('Submit'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**Questions:**
1. What is the purpose of the `TextField` widget in Flutter?
2. How can you retrieve input from a `TextField`?
3. What is the difference between `FlatButton` and `ElevatedButton`?

### 4.2 Form Validation
Forms can be validated to ensure the input meets certain criteria. Use the `GlobalKey<FormState>` to manage form validation.

#### Example:
```
class FormValidationExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _FormValidationExampleState createState() => _FormValidationExampleState();
}

class _FormValidationExampleState extends State<FormValidationExample> {
  final _formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>();
  String? _inputValue;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Form(
      key: _formKey,
      child: Column(
        children: [
          TextFormField(
            validator: (value) {
              if (value == null || value.isEmpty) {
                return 'Please enter some text';
              }
              return null;
            },
            onSaved: (value) {
              _inputValue = value;
            },
          ),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              if (_formKey.currentState!.validate()) {
                _formKey.currentState!.save();
                print('Saved value: $_inputValue');
              }
            },
            child: Text('Submit'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**Questions:**
1. How do you implement validation for a form in Flutter?
2. What is the role of `GlobalKey<FormState>` in form validation?
3. What happens if a form field fails validation?

### 4.3 Managing State (setState, Blocs)
State management is crucial in Flutter. You can manage state using `setState` for local state or state management solutions like BLoC for more complex scenarios.

#### Example of setState:
```
class SimpleCounter extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SimpleCounterState createState() => _SimpleCounterState();
}

class _SimpleCounterState extends State<SimpleCounter> {
  int _count = 0;

  void _increment() {
    setState(() {
      _count++;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        Text('Count: $_count'),
        ElevatedButton(onPressed: _increment, child: Text('Increment')),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

**Questions:**
1. How does `setState` work in managing local state?
2. What are the benefits of using BLoC for state management?
3. When should you consider using a state management solution like Provider or Riverpod?
